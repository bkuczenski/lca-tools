"""
Contexts in this sense are environmental compartments, except they have the added capability to keep lists of origins.

Edelen and Ingwersen et al 2017:
"Recommendations: ...setting an exclusive or inclusive nomenclature for flow context information that includes
directionality and environmental compartment information."

In the antelope architecture, there are two different objectives for handling contexts as-presented by the data source.

 In the default case, for every static resource or stand-alone archive a "TermManager" is created which is captive to
 the archive.  The role of this class is to collect information from the data source in as close to its native
 presentation as possible. This creates an "inclusive" nomenclature for the source.

 In the Catalog case, both catalog's local quantity DB is an LciaEngine, which is also shared among all non-static
 resources (including remote resources).  In this case the objective is to match a given context to the existing
 (exclusive) nomenclature built-in to the LciaEngine, so that contexts are guaranteed to coincide during LCIA.

In order to accomplish this, the native add_context() method needs to be expansive, fault tolerant, and widely accepting
of diverse inputs, whereas find_matching_context() needs to be more discerning and rigorous.
