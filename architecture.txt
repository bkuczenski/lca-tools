Re-structuring the repo into several repos.  Objectives:

 * 'core' repository should include interfaces and everything that would be required to use them
   - should have close to zero dependencies ('six' is the only one presently- should move to eight?)
   - a brightway2 instance should only require this import, to make an archive

 * antelope-catalog: mutual requirement for catalog + foregrounds + fragments
   - also includes (? or should it?) providers- ilcd, ecospold2, olca, traci, etc
   - av1 and av2 clients
   = introduce dependencies: lxml, marshmallow-- not much else tho

 * antelope-background: partial ordering (requires scipy)

 * antelope-v2-server: for deploying either node (ext ref) or catalog (link) servers

 * antelope-v1-server: compat, anyway- required to show off the current app

OR- I could learn javascript and write a new app using the av1/2 api

how does lcopt do it again?
